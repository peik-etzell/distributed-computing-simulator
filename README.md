Implementation of PN/Local model in python for challenge excercise of CS-E4510 Distributed Algorithms

__$\star$ Exercise 3.6 (implementation)__ (from [course literature](https://github.com/suomela/da2020))

_Using your favorite programming language, implement a simulator that lets you play with distributed algorithms in the port-numbering model. Implement the algorithms for bipartite maximal matching and minimum vertex cover 3-approximation and try them out in the simulator._
